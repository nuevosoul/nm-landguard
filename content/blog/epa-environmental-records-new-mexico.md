# EPA Environmental Records: Hidden History Beneath New Mexico Land

*Published: [DATE] | Reading time: 9 min*

That gorgeous mesa property looks pristine. Miles of open space, mountain views, not a neighbor in sight. But what you can't see is what might hurt you — decades of industrial activity, abandoned mining operations, and contaminated groundwater that could turn your dream property into an environmental liability.

Welcome to the unglamorous world of EPA environmental records.

## New Mexico's Industrial Legacy

New Mexico's history is written in uranium mines, military bases, oil fields, and research labs. While these industries built the state's economy, they also left behind contamination that persists for generations:

**Mining:**
- The **Grants Uranium Belt** (Grants, Milan, Ambrosia Lake) once produced 340 million pounds of uranium
- Over 500 abandoned uranium mines remain across the state
- Groundwater contamination from mining can spread miles from the source

**Military & Research:**
- **Los Alamos National Laboratory** — birthplace of the atomic bomb
- **Sandia National Laboratories** — decades of weapons research
- **Kirtland Air Force Base** — massive jet fuel leak discovered in 1999
- **White Sands Missile Range** — ongoing testing and historical contamination

**Oil & Gas:**
- The Permian Basin (southeast NM) has thousands of active and abandoned wells
- Produced water disposal has contaminated aquifers
- Pipeline leaks and spills are common

**Agriculture:**
- Pesticide accumulation in soil
- Fertilizer contamination of groundwater
- Legacy chemicals from defunct operations

## What EPA Tracks

The Environmental Protection Agency maintains several databases that reveal environmental history:

### Superfund Sites (CERCLIS/SEMS)

**What it is:** The most serious contaminated sites, requiring long-term federal cleanup.

**What it means for buyers:** If a Superfund site is within a mile of your property, you need to understand:
- The contamination source and extent
- Groundwater flow direction
- Cleanup status and timeline
- Potential access restrictions

**New Mexico Superfund sites include:**
- South Valley Superfund Site (Albuquerque) — pesticide manufacturing
- Jackpile-Paguate Uranium Mine (Laguna Pueblo)
- North Railroad Avenue Plume (Espanola)
- Los Alamos National Laboratory (several areas)

### Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)

**What it is:** Annual reports from facilities that release toxic chemicals into air, water, or land.

**What it means for buyers:** Shows which facilities are *currently* releasing pollutants in your area. Industries required to report include:
- Chemical manufacturing
- Mining
- Power generation
- Food processing with chemical use

### Brownfield Sites

**What it is:** Formerly developed properties that may have contamination but aren't serious enough for Superfund listing.

**What it means for buyers:** Common in small towns with industrial history — old gas stations, dry cleaners, auto repair shops. Many have been cleaned up and are safe, but some remain problematic.

### RCRA Facilities

**What it is:** Sites that generate, transport, treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

**What it means for buyers:** Not all RCRA sites are contaminated — many are properly managed. But proximity to treatment/storage/disposal facilities warrants extra investigation.

## The Real Risks

### Groundwater Contamination

The most common issue in New Mexico. Contaminants can travel underground for miles from the original source. If your property uses well water:

- **Upstream industrial history matters** — follow the groundwater flow
- **Testing is essential** — contaminants may be odorless/tasteless
- **Treatment costs money** — some contamination requires expensive filtration
- **Disclosure may be required** — future sale could be complicated

### Soil Contamination

Common near:
- Former gas stations (petroleum hydrocarbons)
- Agricultural operations (pesticides, arsenic)
- Mining areas (heavy metals, radioactive materials)
- Old orchards (lead arsenate was a common pesticide pre-1940s)

**Practical impact:**
- Garden restrictions
- Construction complications
- Soil removal/capping costs
- Health risks for children and pets

### Vapor Intrusion

Volatile contaminants in soil or groundwater can rise as gases and accumulate in buildings. Often undetectable without testing. Common with:
- Petroleum contamination
- Chlorinated solvents (from dry cleaners, degreasers)
- Landfill gases

## Due Diligence Steps

### 1. Check EPA's Envirofacts

The EPA's Facility Registry System (FRS) shows regulated facilities near any location:
- [Envirofacts](https://enviro.epa.gov/)
- [NEPAssist mapping tool](https://www.epa.gov/nepa/nepassist)

### 2. Search Superfund Sites

- [Superfund Site Search](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live)
- Check the National Priorities List (NPL)
- Review Site Cleanup Status reports

### 3. Review State Records

The **New Mexico Environment Department (NMED)** maintains additional databases:
- Underground storage tank registry
- Voluntary remediation sites
- Air quality permits
- Hazardous waste facilities

### 4. Check County Records

- Recorded environmental liens
- Environmental land use restrictions
- Activity and use limitations (AULs)

### 5. Order an Environmental Site Assessment

For properties with any red flags, consider a **Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA)**:
- Standard ASTM practice (E1527-21)
- Reviews historical records, aerial photos, regulatory databases
- Includes site inspection
- Typically costs $2,000-$4,000

**When a Phase I is essential:**
- Commercial or industrial property purchase
- Undeveloped land in former industrial area
- Property with visible contamination signs
- Any property near known contamination sites

## Special New Mexico Considerations

### Uranium Legacy

If your property is anywhere near the Grants Mineral Belt or former uranium processing areas:
- Test for radon (high natural background + mining activities)
- Check for mine tailings (look for yellowish/gray soil piles)
- Review groundwater testing data
- Consider gamma radiation survey

### Military Buffer Zones

Land near military installations may have:
- Unexploded ordnance (old testing ranges)
- PFAS contamination (firefighting foam)
- Restricted airspace affecting development
- Security-related access limitations

### Oil & Gas Areas

In the Permian Basin and San Juan Basin:
- Check for orphaned wells on or near property
- Review produced water disposal history
- Assess potential for induced seismicity
- Consider air quality impacts

### Historic Mining Districts

New Mexico has hundreds of historic mining districts:
- Hard rock mining (gold, silver, copper) leaves heavy metals
- Coal mining can cause subsidence
- Mill sites often highly contaminated
- Mine drainage can affect surface water

## Red Flags in Property Listings

Watch for language that might indicate environmental issues:

- *"Sold as-is"* — could mean known problems
- *"Environmental study available"* — means there's already concern
- *"Former industrial site"* — needs investigation
- *"Groundwater may not be potable"* — contamination likely
- Unusually low price for location — ask why

## What Our Reports Include

A Rio Grande Due Diligence report searches EPA and state databases to identify:

✓ **Superfund sites** within 5 miles  
✓ **Toxic Release Inventory** facilities within 3 miles  
✓ **RCRA hazardous waste** facilities within 1 mile  
✓ **Brownfield sites** within 1 mile  
✓ **Contamination risk assessment** — low/moderate/high  

We can't replace a Phase I ESA, but we can tell you whether you need one — before you fall in love with a property that could become an environmental nightmare.

## The Bottom Line

Environmental contamination doesn't respect property lines. A site miles away can affect your groundwater. Contamination from 50 years ago can still make your land unusable today.

The good news: most New Mexico land is clean. The bad news: you can't tell by looking.

Do your homework before you buy. Check the databases. Understand the history. And if anything looks questionable, get professional testing before you close.

Your dream property should stay a dream — not become a cleanup project.
