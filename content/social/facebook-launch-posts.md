**🏜️ Buying land in New Mexico? Get answers before you buy.**

We just launched **Rio Grande Due Diligence** — an instant report that tells you what you're actually buying.

For $499, you get:
✅ Water rights analysis (can you drill a well? what's the basin status?)
✅ FEMA flood zone mapping
✅ EPA environmental records (Superfund, contamination, industrial history)
✅ Zoning & land use
✅ Elevation, soil, and solar potential
✅ Parcel boundaries & legal description

**Why it matters:** New Mexico has some of the most complex water rights in the country. Acequia rights, OSE permits, declared vs. undeclared basins — most buyers have no idea what they're getting into until it's too late.

We pull from state and federal databases so you don't have to spend weeks researching or thousands on consultants.

**Try it:** [riograndedd.com](https://riograndedd.com) (or [preview--nm-landguard.lovable.app](https://preview--nm-landguard.lovable.app) if main site pending)

Happy to answer questions. Built this because I wish I'd had it before buying our place in Rio Arriba.

**Water rights in Northern NM are complicated. Now there's a way to check before you buy.**

Just launched a tool that runs instant due diligence on any NM address:

🔍 **What's the water situation?** OSE well permits nearby, basin status, acequia districts, domestic well feasibility

🔍 **Any environmental red flags?** EPA records, mining history, contamination sites

🔍 **What are you actually buying?** Parcel data, zoning, legal description, flood zones

We've all heard the stories — someone buys 20 acres thinking they'll build their dream home, then discovers they can't get a well permit or the property sits in a flood zone.

This pulls everything into one report so you know what you're dealing with before you make an offer.

**$499 per report.** Takes about 2 minutes to run.

## Post 3: Off-Grid / Homesteading Angle

**Planning to go off-grid in NM? Here's what you need to check first.**

Building off-grid in New Mexico sounds great until you discover:
- The well you planned won't get approved
- Your "remote" parcel is in a flood plain
- There's an old mining claim or contamination nearby
- The solar potential isn't what you thought

We built **Rio Grande Due Diligence** to answer these questions *before* you buy.

One report covers:
☀️ Solar potential (annual sun hours, optimal panel placement)
💧 Water: basin status, nearby wells, permit requirements
🏔️ Elevation & soil composition
⚠️ Environmental: EPA records, Superfund, industrial history
📐 Parcel: boundaries, acreage, zoning, legal description

**$499** — way cheaper than finding out the hard way.

## Posting Strategy

1. **Don't spam** — one post per group, spaced out over a few days
2. **Engage authentically** — answer questions, provide value
3. **Personal angle** — mention the "built this because I needed it" story
4. **No hard sell** — educational tone, let people come to us
5. **Monitor comments** — respond within hours

## Timing

- Post mid-week (Tue-Thu) for best engagement
- Avoid weekends when groups are slower
- Morning or early evening posts perform better
